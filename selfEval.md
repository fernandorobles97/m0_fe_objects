# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 
There were points when it felt difficult and confusing, but having built steadier relationships with my classmates allowed us to talk through the confusion and work together to get the best possible outcome. This feeling of unity is definitely motivating and rewarding. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I'm definitely getting better at managing my time when it comes to organizing these things, but being at my current full-time job at the hospital while working through Mod 0 makes it much more difficult to organize and plan things out with having an abnormal schedule. I'm excited to see how I'll organize and adapt once Mod 1 begins and can fully immerse into being a full-time student. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? 
 The final challenge where we worked with arrays and objects was very interesting and fun to learn. I'm excited to see how we could utilize these concepts in the future. Remembering all the syntax rules would be great; especially when considering how forgetting to add one space can cause a whole code block to not work.
